## Stress as limited cognitive resource


_Robert, G., and J. Hockey. "Compensatory control in the regulation of human performance under stress and high workload: A cognitive-energetical framework." Biological psychology 45.1 (1997): 73-93._

### Goal:

to confirm that cognitive resources are limited, and stress & high workload take up those limited resources

### Evidence:

### Abstract

"Regulation of goals and actions” … “allocates resources dynamically."
The controllers for the resource allocation have "different modes of performance-cost trade-off:

- Performance maintained under stress, at the cost of "increased efforts", and other "behavioral and physiological costs"
- “Performance goals” reduced, with no extra costs

### Introduction:

> “Intimate relationship between behavior and its biological / motivational context"

def. Cognitive energetics:

- computational models of human information processing need biological context of behavior, too.
- Need energy-based constructs into information processing models

def. compensatory control: 

- accounts for patterns of performance under stress and high workload

Energetical processes, information processing models —> generalized control model

### 1.1 Resources and effort

def. resources: 

- has roots in: information processing and energetic theories; dual-task performance

Capacity theories

- common energy sources
