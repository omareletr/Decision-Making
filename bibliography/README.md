## Stress as limited cognitive resource


_Robert, G., and J. Hockey. "Compensatory control in the regulation of human performance under stress and high workload: A cognitive-energetical framework." Biological psychology 45.1 (1997): 73-93._

- Goal:
   - to confirm that cognitive resources are limited, and stress & high workload take up those limited resources
- Evidence:
  - Abstract

>"Regulation of goals and actions” … “allocates resources dynamically."
> The controllers for the resource allocation have "different modes of performance-cost trade-off:

- Performance maintained under stress, at the cost of 

> "increased efforts", and other "behavioral and physiological costs"

- “Performance goals” reduced, with no extra costs

- Introduction:

> “Intimate relationship between behavior and its biological / motivational context"

  - def. Cognitive energetics:
    - computational models of human information processing need biological context of behavior, too.
    - Need energy-based constructs into information processing models

  - def. compensatory control: 
    - accounts for patterns of performance under stress and high workload
  - Energetical processes, information processing models —> generalized control model

- 1.1 Resources and effort
  - def. resources: 
    - has roots in: information processing and energetic theories; dual-task performance
  - Capacity theories
    - common energy sources

## Report on implicit bias

_State of the Science: Implicit Bias Review 2015_

- p.9
  - Cognitive control may be impeded by circumstance such as high cognitive load.
- p.19
  - .... research that demonstrates the correlation among high levels of cognitive load,s high stress environments and the reliance on automatic or unconscious processes in which stereotypes and unconscious beliefs are more likely to be activated.

- p.21
  - Implicit association test (IAT)
  - Trauma surgeons work in high-stress, time constrained, and high mental and physical fatigue environments - environments in which implicit bias can impact judgments and decision-making.

    - In this study, these biases were not statistically significantly associated with clinical decision making.
- p.66
  - Engaging in deliberative processing can help counter implicit biases, particularly during situations in which decision-makers may face time constraint or a weighty cognitive load (4 ref's).
