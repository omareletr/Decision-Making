# Project Description

## Background



1. Technology has become a mediator for decision-making 



2. We know that people make bad decisions under stress/workload.. bad decisions can have serious consequences (motivate with some real-world scenarios -> medical, air-traffic controllers)



3. There are now wearable sensors where we can predict when you might make a bad decision


4. So we're building 'attentive computers' that present us decisions when we are best equipped to handle them

(Identify a problem to be solved / innovation)


A graph of workload v.s. time?




## This Project

A synopsis for the background / purpose and methods --> know what's going on.

## Methods


? Senior design 
* Equipment
	Monitors for physiological signals (and brain)
* Empatica E4: contains a heart-rate sensor, 3-axis accelerometer, skin temperature + heat flux sensor, and electrodermal activity sensor. (credibility / reliability of this new device )
* Muse (possibly) EEG (Electroencephalography)
	* Established psychology methods?
		* We'll use established psychology tasks to manipulate workload/stress. For example, we can use the n-back task or digit span task ← 

* We'll also use established decision-making questions that have been validated by the psychology community (the chocolate cake and fruit salad)
* Coding?
* Lit. review?

* Explain why this project is super awesome and __feasible__

Starting from a big concept, 
Combining pre-existing? (figured-out?) technology in an innovative way.





A summative flow chart-ish figure? 



### Timeline

June, July, August


I may be away for 1 to 3 weeks, but the research time should add up to 10 weeks

## Anticipated Outcome

* Making better decisions??? / Measurable?
* Writing?
* Conference?


Why I qualify for the job??

Experience with research
Intro econ class and some behavioral econ reading
Major related
Confident that .. 



# Research Environment

I will work closely with Professor Peck throughout the research period. Professor Peck will be present and available over the summer, and there will be daily discussions and weekly summarizations. We will collaborate on multiple levels, from generating new ideas to coding. Because of the digital nature of this project, Professor Peck has planned on a practical project management system which consists of several online services.

Where: in comp. labs?

We will also work with people at Bucknell and in other institutions. For instance, Professor Joaquin Gomez-Minambres specializes in behavioral economics and decision-making, and has expressed interest in this project;

Prof. Peck: I have to write something similar about research environment. Here is a quick draft of what I’ll likely submitting (you can draw on this to write this section): 
I consider undergraduate students who work with me to be collaborators. Inspired by lab structures I observed at MIT during my time in Boston, I believe that interaction drives momentum in a project through frequent feedback. As a result, I intend to engage in the following ways with Xiaoying:
1)    Collocation: I will be present and available for any students working with me over the summer. This involves daily interaction, an open-door policy for my office, and more formal weekly summarizations.
2)    Idea generation: Although I proposed to the initial framework of the project (the primary research question), we will work together to formulate designs and solutions.
3)    Code Collaboration: I intend to have sessions in which I code alongside any students working with me.
4)    Project Organization and Feedback: after talking with colleagues of mine at various companies (Twitter, ChoiceMap), I am constructing a project management foundation to encourage digital communication. This includes the following:
a.     Slack and Trello: web based communications tools to streamline and organize project communication.
b.     GitLab: for code management and collaboration
c.     Google Drive: for design document and paper writing collaboration.
5)    Inclusion in Collaborations with other Universities: I expect to include students in meetings with collaborators both at Bucknell and at other universities. For example, [insert collaborators].
