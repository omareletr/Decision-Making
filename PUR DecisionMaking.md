Project Description
===================

Background
----------

1.  <span>*Decision making and cognitive overload*</span>\
    People tend to make bad decisions when they are under stress or
    heavy workload.\
    $\lefthalfcup$ According to <span>*Thinking, Fast and Slow*</span>,
    our thought process could be explained by two systems: “System 1” is
    fast and instinctive, and “System 2” is deliberate and logical. When
    people are performing complicated tasks that occupies the limited
    processing capability of “System 2”, people tend to make decisions
    based on immediate affection instead of logic and cognition. This
    conflict of affect and cognition in decision making is presented
    through a popular experiment involving a choice between chocolate
    cake and fruit salad (Shiv and Fedorikhin !!). When the experiment
    respondents were asked to memorize long numbers, their mind
    occupied, they tended to choose unhealthy chocolate cakes over the
    fruit salad.\
    In the real-world, people face decisions more serious than choosing
    a desert. Bad decisions made in unsuitable cognitive conditions can
    have serious consequences. For instance, air-traffic controllers’
    tasks often entail high cognitive workload involving information
    processing and logic reasoning. In 2002, a controller, Peter
    Nielsen, was under heavy workload, and his mistake led to the
    Überlingen mid-air collision that claimed 71 lives.\
    $\lefthalfcup$ Throw out some stats about stress $\rightarrow$ tis
    important?

2.  <span>*Technology has become a mediator for decision-making*</span>\
    $\lefthalfcup$ mediator?? interface?? We make decision on
    computers?\
    $\lefthalfcup$ Example? / stats?\
    $\lefthalfcup$ Still, computers generally have a poor understanding
    of the users. By the mere means of keyboards or touch screens, much
    of the relational information present in social contexts is not
    understood by computers.\
    $\lefthalfcup$ Computers make things worse?\
    $\lefthalfcup$ Computers could do better in mediating
    decision-making by gaining a better understanding in users’ state of
    mind.

3.  <span>*Wearable physiological sensor as solution*</span>\
    Stress could manifest as many characteristic physical signals, such
    as sweating,\
    $\lefthalfcup$ (what are the detectable symptoms?)\
    Physiological signals could now be acquired through a variety of
    burgeoning wearable sensors, such as wristbands and headbands. We
    could process those physiological signals to decide whether the user
    is in a stressed state or not. There are several advantages that
    make wearable sensors suitable for mediating decision-making:

    1.  (As opposed to traditional EEG’s, ) Wearable sensors are
        portable enough to be used in everyday working environment,
        where decision making take place.

    2.  Users can provide input to computers via wearable sensors,
        without interrupting their tasks and thought processes.

    3.  ??

This Project
------------

[20,000 ft] Problem statement: Given that wearable sensors could inform
computers of our state of mind, we propose to build an “attentive”
computer system that could present us with decisions when we are best
equipped to handle them.

Current state-of-art:\
Currently there are very few

Multidisciplinary

Some of the challenges?

Value proposition? / target customers / users? Explain why this project
is super awesome and **feasible**

Starting from a big concept, Combining preexisting? (figured-out?)
technology in an innovative way.

Breakdown / scope / brief methods

As shown in figure [figure:mindmap], this projects could be resolved
into three parts:

1.  A senior design team is currently working on a program framework
    that could determine whether a user is stressed or not. This
    framework takes form of a biocybernetic loop (? really looping?): it
    takes sensor input and outputs state judgment on the user.

2.  This is the question

3.  Experiment participants given tasks (stress) and make decisions?

![Is this what it is??](hci_mindmap "fig:") [figure:mindmap]

Methods
-------

### Sensors

We will potentially use two wearable sensors to acquire physiological
signals:

-   Empatica E4: it is a wristband that contains a heart-rate sensor,
    3-axis accelerometer, skin temperature + heat flux sensor, and
    electrodermal activity sensor. (credibility / reliability of this
    new device / how it detects stress)

-   Muse (possibly): it is a miniature EEG (Electroencephalography) in a
    headband.

### Implementation

????

### Experimental methods

In order to assess the effectiveness of our system, we want to create
controlled stress level and decision-making process. Established
psychology tasks will be used to manipulate stress level. For example,
we can use the n-back task or digit span. [ref!!]

We’ll also use established decision-making questions that have been
validated by the psychology community. For instance

### Time Line {#timeline}

Anticipated Outcome
-------------------

-   Making better decisions??? / Measurable? How to assess the outcome?
    / by parts?

-   Pertinence to Professor Peck’s research interests

-   Learning outcome / extension of interest in research, behavioral
    economics and CS

-   Writing?

-   Conference?

Research Environment
====================

I will work closely with Professor Peck throughout the research period.
Professor Peck will be present and available over the summer, and there
will be daily discussions and weekly summarizations. We will collaborate
on multiple levels, from generating new ideas to coding. Because of the
digital nature of this project, Professor Peck has planned on a
practical project management system that includes GitLab, Google Drive,
Slack and Trello. This research will be conducted in Dana or Breakiron
labs.

We will also work with people at Bucknell and in other institutions. For
instance, Professor Joaquin Gomez-Minambres in Economics Department
specializes in behavioral economics and decision-making, and has
expressed interest in collaborating on this project. Professor Erin
Solovey at Drexel University could provide insight into processing
physiological data.
